### Aproach

We wanted a clear and simply way to get the data from the json file, analyze the data, put it into visualisations and then make it available for public viewing.
We decided that getting the data from the JSON file would take the least amount of converting from collection to visualisation.
After obtaining the data, we used arrays to sort it numerically.
