## User Experience & Integration Focus:

Where we built a data visualization using data served up at a set of API Endpoints (on Augur Health).

We did visualisations in 3 tables of collected date: 
  -  10 repositories with most commits,  
   -  5 repositories with highest number of issues, 
   -  Total number of commits across all repositories & Average number of commits for all repositories. 
     

The markdowns of the process, code & group assesment can be found:

The github link to the final project can be found:
